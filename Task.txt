1)Difference between http1 vs http2:
    Http1:
          *It works on the textual format.
          *HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources            behind it.
          *It uses requests resource inlining for use getting multiple pages.
          It compresses data by itself.
    Http2:  
          *It works on the binary protocol.
          *http2 is more reliable than http1.
          *HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP(Transmission control protocol) connection to send multiple streams of data at                once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
          *It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
          *It uses HPACK for data compression.
